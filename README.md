# Challenge 5 - AWS API Gateway CRUD REST API

Build a Serverless Framework REST API with AWS API Gateway which supports CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete) *don't use service proxy integration directly to DynamoDB from API Gateway

Please use GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline, AWS CodePipeline, or Serverless Pro CI/CD to handle deployments.

You can take screenshots of the CI/CD setup and include them in the README.

The CI/CD should trigger a deployment based on a git push to the master branch which goes through and deploys the backend Serverless Framework REST API and any other resources e.g. DynamoDB Table(s).

### Requirements

0. All application code must be written using NodeJS, Typescript is acceptable as well

1. All AWS Infrastructure needs to be automated with IAC using [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com)

2. The API Gateway REST API should store data in DynamoDB

3. There should be 4-5 lambdas that include the following CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete) *don't use service proxy integration directly to DynamoDB from API Gateway

3. Build the CI/CD pipeline to support multi-stage deployments e.g. dev, prod

4. The template should be fully working and documented

4. A public GitHub repository must be shared with frequent commits

5. A video should be recorded (www.loom.com) of you talking over the application code, IAC, and any additional areas you want to highlight in your solution to demonstrate additional skills

Please spend only what you consider a reasonable amount of time for this.

## Optionally

Please feel free to include any of the following to show additional experience:

1. Make the project fit a specific business case e.g. Coffee Shop APIs vs Notes CRUD directly from AWS docs
2. AWS Lambda packaging
3. Organization of YAML files
4. Bash/other scripts to support deployment
5. Unit tests, integration tests, etc
